# Forest Whispers (Zhíniàn) - Product Requirements

## V1.3 - Atmospheric Immersion Update
**Date**: 2026-01-29

### 1. Weather Simulation (The Atmosphere)
To enhance the "Here & Now" feeling, the home screen (ForestMap) must simulate ambient weather effects.

- **Types**:
  - **Sunny (晴天)**: Warm, subtle light leaks, gentle atmosphere.
  - **Rainy (雨天)**: Vertical falling droplets, slightly darker/cooler tone, melancholic but cozy.
  - **Windy (刮风)**: Faster movement of abstract terrain lines, floating "leaves" or particles.
  - **Cloudy (多云)**: Soft, diffused light, neutral tone.

- **Behavior**:
  - Weather is randomized on session start (or changed periodically) to provide variety.
  - The effects must be **aesthetic and subtle (唯美)**, not distracting game-like effects.
  - **Synchronization**: The "Poetic Location" text at the top must reflect the current weather (e.g., "Shanghai · Rainy Twin Mountains").

### 2. Time Synchronization (The Clock)
- **Real-time**: The time displayed in the Poetic Location must match the user's actual local time.
- **Format**: HH:MM (e.g., 15:42).

### 3. General Vibe
- Maintain the "Slow Tech" philosophy.
- Animations should use CSS keyframes for performance and smoothness.
